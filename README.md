 This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab. 

# Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:

    ``linux> make``

Check the correctness of your simulator:

    ``linux> ./test-csim``

# Files:
***********************

The only file that the autograder will collect is the csim.c file,
so implement your cache simulator in that file only.

# Tools for evaluating your simulator
Makefile     Builds the simulator
